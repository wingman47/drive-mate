# Drive Mate

## Description
In contemporary urban environments, challenges such as increasing traffic congestion, rising fuel costs, and environmental concerns emphasize the need for an innovative and sustainable transportation solution. The absence of a streamlined platform connecting individuals with available vehicles to those seeking rides results in inefficient resource use, prolonged commute times, heightened carbon emissions, and increased financial burden on commuters. To address these challenges, we propose the development of Drive Mate - a comprehensive carpooling app.

## Features
### Common Destination Pool
Connects users with shared destinations, creating a community of co-travellers for schools, colleges, grocery stores, pet shops, and more.

### Smart Matching
Efficiently pairs riders and drivers based on shared destinations, providing a tailored and effective commuting solution.

### Search in Radius
Allows users to search for potential co-travellers within a specified radius, expanding the possibilities for convenient rides.

### Fair Fuel Cost Distribution
Features transparent fare distribution for equitable sharing of fuel costs among co-travellers, ensuring cost-effective and fair carpooling.

### Real-Time Scheduling
Allows users to schedule rides in real-time or plan in advance, offering flexibility and a user-friendly experience.

### Reduced Traffic Congestion
Optimizes commuting patterns and reduces the number of individual vehicles on the road, actively contributing to mitigating traffic congestion and ensuring a more efficient urban transportation landscape.

## Workflow of the App

** User Registration **
User A signs up on the Drive Mate app, indicating common destinations like schools or grocery stores.

** Smart Matching **
The app identifies User B, heading to the same destination, and suggests a match based on proximity and preferences.

** Search in Radius **
User C searches for potential co-travellers within a specified radius, expanding the possibilities for convenient rides.

** Ride Request **
User A schedules a ride, receives driver options, and chooses User B or User C, who confirm the ride.

** Fair Fare Sharing ** 
The app calculates fuel costs and transparently divides expenses between User A and User B or User C.
